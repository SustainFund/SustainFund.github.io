# SUSTAIN IMPROVEMENT 

Need less. Constantly improve to reduce footprint. Eliminate vulnerabilities and excess baggage.

Exercise DISCIPLINE to eliminate needs, to become a tougher example of FREEDOM. You are alive NOW, so behave like you are on a date with NOW with an objective to fall in love with NOW. Commit to enjoying NOW; the only thing that NOW wants from you is for you to be more able to love NOW tomorrow. 

Loving NOW is a matter of discipline.

* ***EACH second of NOW in each 86400 second day must improve the DISCIPLINE of each following second of NOW.***

* ***Instill CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING discipline by multitasking, yet focusing on this NOWNESS of personal improvement.*** 

In the end, it is the **DISCIPLINE** of *sustained improvement* which **equals FREEDOM** ... there is no other path to freedom. You can never buy freedom or give it to others. There are addictive materialist illusions of freedom, there is no substitute for not needing anything. 

# Zero Overhead Philanthropy

Funding is seldom the answer to any problem. Refuse to enable fundraisers that are perpetually fundraising in fund perpetual fundraising. Don't give in to guilt or ego; keep your powder dry. Conserve your capital for the cases in which you can ensure that capital matters -- until then, invest wisely. Don't worry, the needs will expand to consume any amount of capital. 

But when some problem really matters to the point where it becomes your WHY, then ***GIVE EVERYTHING -- GIVE ALL YOUR TIME***

Until then, *stop kidding yourself that writing checks or practicing idiot compassion will fix anything.* 

If you actually care, then ***EMBODY genuine compassion.*** become engaged as a disciplined human ... not just a problem solver gadget or machine, but a caring, compassionate human. ***EMBODY the continously improving discipline of genuine compassion.***
