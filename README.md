# Zero Overhead Philanthropy

*BE a human. BE a problem solver. EMBODY genuine compassion ... give yourself to eliminating problems rather than fundraising to fund perpetual fundraising or practicing idiot compassion.*


The FACTS are that most charity is a delusion. Almost everything that drives checkbook charity and the use of guilt to contribute to charities is that most [if not almost ALL] philanthropies are nothing but fundraising organizations that raise funds in order to raise funds in order to sustain the perpetuation of the fundraising organization.  Other organizations are actually ineffective because the cure cuts off funding for the philanthropy. There are reasons to suspect why this might be true of much of the funding for elimination of cancer, heart disease, diabetes/insulin resistance, for example.

Therefore, this Github *organization* known as SustainFund is a curated collection of repositories of curated lists and resources exist as proof that of #NoOverhead venture philanthropies can sponsor and maintain funding to sustain efforts to find root causes of problems so that the problem can be eliminated sustainably, forever.


Needs are real, if you see someone who needs a sandwich, make them a sandwich and talk with them -- don't donate to an organization that funds operations which might buy professional services which just throw wastefood sandwiches at people who have problems that will cause them to always need more sandwiches -- almost of all the money you give ends up funding virtue signallers and almost nothing actually gets the hungry person the sandwich. ***Don't fund the perpetuation of misery.***

If it were not obvious ... there's absolutely NO MONEY in SustainFund. This open source curated collections of repositories prove that money is generally UNNECESSARY ... if you want to help someone, ***then just roll up your sleeves and HELP someone human-to-human*** -- don't write a check or text #BullshitConsciousClearing to BullshitConsciousClearning.com ... 

If something really matters, then ***GIVE YOUR TIME***, give your inspired intellect, give your mind, give your ideas ... *give a legitimate shit DAILY* ... thoroughly **give YOURSELF** to directly, personally sustaining the ELIMINATION of the problem. Or stop pretending.
